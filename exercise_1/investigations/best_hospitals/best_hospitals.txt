Approach:

	By looking at the data, hospitals are evaluated by various aspect of their procedures. In order to be a model of high-quality care, a hospital should be first having high overall ratings, and at the same time, doing relatively well on all aspects.

	I was first looking at the overall ratings which is a score based on each measures it evaluates and should be able to best answer this question but not granular enough to rank each hospital towards others. So I had to look into its performance on each of the 7 matrix.  

	So, based on the observations above, I had created a scoring mechanism to rank the hospitals. It is equally weighted on each matrix and the score is: above national average=3; same as national average=2; below national average=1. Then I create the mean and variance of those 7 matrix for each hospital and rank them by having the highest overal rating and mean score, and the lowest variance hospitals on the top.

	For the "Not Available" values in the overall rating and each matrix, I exclude record with NA in overall ratings from the analysis and treat those with overall score but has NA in some of the matrix as 0. I was counting how many record I would have to remove if I want to remove all with not availables and it is nearly half of the records. I think removing NA in this case will not keep the representative of the population so I decide to keep those with an actual overall rating. After decide to keep records with some not available values, I decide to treat them as 0 because I want to penalize those with unknown but potentially poor behavoir in my analysis. I would like the hospital I listed perform well on every aspect of the matrix for sure.
