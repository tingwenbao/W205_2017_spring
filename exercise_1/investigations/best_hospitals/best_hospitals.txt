Approach:
	By looking at the data, hospitals are evaluated by various aspect of their procedures. In order to be a model of high-quality care, a hospital should be doing relatively well on all aspects.
	I was first looking at the overall ratings which is a score based on each measures it evaluates and should be able to answer this question. The overall rating is a score from 1-5 (it is available for some hospital). The total number of hospital with the highest overal rating 5 is 82. The rating bucket is large that it does not separate those within this bucket well. 
	Then I take a look at what are the hospital with overal ratings=5 look like by select 5 examples of them. I then noticed that in order to get a 5, you don't need to be above national average for everything. I also further run a query to see how many hospital had got above national average for every aspects. It turns out that none of them meet this criteria.
	So, based on the observations above, I had created a scoring mechanism to rank the hospitals. It is equally weighted on each aspect and the score is above national average > same as national average > below national average. I treat missing and not available data as 0 instead of the same as national average because I would like to list the hospitals that are great in every aspect for sure.
