10 procedures with the greatest variability between hospitals:
Measure_id	Measure_Name	RSD
VTE_6   Hospital acquired potentially preventable venous thromboembolism       2.44
PC_01	Percent of newborns whose deliveries were scheduled early (1-3 weeks early), when a scheduled delivery was not medically necessary	1.91
OP_22	Left before being seen	0.99
OP_20	Door to diagnostic eval	0.71
OP_5	Median Time to ECG	0.64
ED_2b	ED2	0.64
OP_3b	Median Time to Transfer to Another Facility for Acute Coronary Intervention	0.56
EDV	Emergency department volume	0.51
OP_1	Median Time to Fibrinolysis	0.45
ED_1b	ED1	0.38

Approach:

	There are two tables with measures consider as procedures that I used to answer this question. There are 36 measures in total and measures have score in different ranges.

	To rank the measure with different ranges on its variation, I calculated the regularized standard deviation of each measure. Regularize standard deviation of each measure will help make an apple to apple comparison.

	In terms of values that are not available. I exclude them from the rsd calculation. I noticed that NA are much more common in some measures that is more rare than others (ex. involving death, etc). But since most of the reason for NA is not enough cases, I think it is reasonable to focus more on the more common procedures.
